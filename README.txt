The main goal of the customer placement project is to distribute customers to restaurant tables and to streamline 
the seating process. Using this system allows for customers to be seated quicker and to optimise table availability, as well as removing some work from 
the waiters and staff. Using this system also allows the restaurant staff to track the occupancy percentage of tables in the restaurant.
